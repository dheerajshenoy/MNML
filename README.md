# MNML
A very minimal custom emacs modeline written in Elisp for Emacs.

# Modules

* EVIL Vim State
* File Name
* Line Position

# Why ?

Wanted to learn elisp and also wanted to make my modeline MNML `:)`

# How does it look ?

# TODO

* Add proper padding settings to the modeline
* Add right aligned items
* Spaceous padding also, maybe ?
* Extra Modules
